Linked List Insert -- Pseudocode
~~~~~~~~~
The elements of the linked list will be represented as ordered pairs.

insert to beginning:
create a pair [key => key, next => *pointer to beginning of list]

insert to end
x = beginning of list
until x[next] points to the terminator,
x = x[next]

insert to middle:
/*count elements in list*/
i = 1
x = beginning of list
until x[next] points to the terminator,
	x = x[next]
	i++
end
i /= 2
x = beginning
i times do
	x = x[next]
y = new element
y[next] = x[next]
x[next] = y

insert to nth space
i = 1
x = beginning
n-1 times do
	x = x[next]
end
y = new element
y[next] = x[next]
x[next] = y
